It is expected that you have some experience with LangChain and LLMs, but this notebook is intended to catch you up in preparation for the later sections!\n",

So for all intents and purposes, it is a \"building-block system\" abstraction where the building blocks are easy to create, have consistent methods (`invoke`, `generate`, `stream`, etc), and can be linked up to work together as a system. Some example legacy chains include `LLMChain`, `ConversationChain`, `TransformationChain`, `SequentialChain`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, a new recommended specification has emerged that is significantly easier to work with and extremely compact, the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**. This new format relies on a different kind of primitive - a **Runnable** - which is simply an object that wraps a function. Allow dictionaries to be implicitly converted to Runnables and let a **pipe |** operator create a Runnable that passes data from the left to the right (i.e. `fn1 | fn2` is a Runnable), and you have a simple way to specify complex logic!\n",
