    "Utilizing [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) for microservice orchestration, our setup makes it relatively simple to add new microservices that adhere to principles like **containerization** and **uniformity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Containerization:** This process encapsulates each service in a standalone container, comprising the necessary software components — code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. These containers interact with host resources and other services through network ports. Key advantages include:\n",
    "    - **Portability:** Facilitating easy transfer and deployment across diverse environments.\n",
    "    - **Isolation:** Ensuring independent operation of each container, minimizing service conflicts.\n",
    "    - **Scalability:** Simplifying the process of scaling services to meet varying demands or changing the *deployment topology* (which services are running on which resources, where they are located, and who is accessing them).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniformity:** Aiming for consistent operation across different environments, Docker ensures that each microservice performs reliably. However, some constraints are noteworthy:\n",
    "    - **Hardware Sensitivity:** Performance may vary in environments with differing hardware, underscoring the need for adaptable microservice design.\n",
    "    - **Environmental Factors:** Variables like network latency or storage capacity can impact container efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more comprehensive overview of Docker and containerization for microservice orcherstation, we'd recommend visiting [Docker's official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) when you have the time. Understanding these principles will be quite useful for those interested in moving their ambitions towards practical deployment."

    "- **Raw Port Access (Default)**, you would change your URL to use the non-default port `8090` by entering `http://<...>.courses.nvidia.com:8090` in your browser. While this method works, it results in a barebones interface with some limitations, such as port protection mechanisms that might block access, reduced functionality due to incomplete integration with the default server settings, and potential security risks from exposing raw ports to users.\n",
    "- **Reverse-Proxy Access**, a different port is reverse-proxied and mapped to `http://<...>.courses.nvidia.com/8090` (where we will use `8091` since the application code has to change) . Reverse-proxying is beneficial because it hides the raw port from users, enhancing security by reducing direct exposure of backend services. It simplifies the URL structure, making it easier for users to access services without remembering specific port numbers. Additionally, reverse-proxying enables better load balancing and easier management of SSL certificates, providing a more seamless and secure user experience. Details out of scope for course, but feel free to check out [**`composer/nginx.conf`**](composer/nginx.conf) and [**`frontend/frontend_server_rproxy.py`**](frontend/frontend_server_rproxy.py).\n",
